	<p>During my Junior year, I took IM3, APCSP, Honors Physics, US History, Honors Spanish, and English.  I definetly stuggled with the work load of Junior year, but I perserved and got good grades in every class.  I feel like a learned a ton this school year, and grew a lot as a student.  I also played high school waterpolo, swam, and played club waterpolo this year.</p>
